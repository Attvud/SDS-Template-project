All icons are optimized using the [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) API. The weight of the icons was reduced by 30-48%. Export settings are specified in [this file](/X/Docs/svgo.json).

Icons have been successfully tested on the following platforms: Web, Android, iOS.

All icons are divided into sections:

1. [Main icons.](/02%20-%20Export/Icons/Main/) ≈ 1,000 icons named and divided by folders according to their value.
2. [Project icons](/02%20-%20Export/Icons/Project/) (social networks, messengers, etc.).
