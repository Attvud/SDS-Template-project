# Logo

Logo is the central visual cue to identify your brand and its official resources, publications, community projects, products, and integrations. Everywhere the logo shows up, it should act and behave the same.


## Primary logo

The primary logo is a combination mark that consists of the monogram/lettermark, and a wordmark. It is the preferred way to reference , allowing newcomers to associate your brand name with the monogram. I encourage you to use it whenever possible.

## Monogram

We use the monogram as social media profile image for our official Twitter and GitHub accounts, and as “favicon” for our official website.

Furthermore the monogram may be used in cases where the association with Gatsby is evident, especially when space is an issue, e.g. like we currently do on store.gatsbyjs.org for mobile devices.
