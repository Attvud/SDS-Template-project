# Logo

Logo is the central visual cue to identify your brand and its official resources, publications, community projects, products, and integrations. Everywhere the logo shows up, it should act and behave the same.


## Primary logo

The primary logo is a combination mark that consists of the monogram/lettermark, and a wordmark. It is the preferred way to reference , allowing newcomers to associate your brand name with the monogram. I encourage you to use it whenever possible.

## Monogram

Monogram is used in social media profile image for official accounts, and as “favicon” for official website.

Furthermore the monogram may be used in cases where the association with your brand is evident.
