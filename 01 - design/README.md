## Colors

![colors.img](/01%20-%20design/export/project%20overview/github/colors.png)

[Here's the SCSS code](https://github.com/Attvud/SDS/blob/master/X/docs/color%20system.scss) that will create variables for the primary and secondary colors, as well as their shades, and add a palette for grayscale. It is important to use the specified grayscale.

Using this solution, you can easily create a behavior for elements (hover, focus, etc.) and refer to each color and its hue by a variable name.

## Typography

![typography.img](/01%20-%20design/export/project%20overview/github/typography.png)

**Legend**: `R` - Regular, `B` - Bold, `LH` - Line Height. The font set used in the project is marked in blue.

Depending on the platform, you should use the following fonts:

- Web - Arial
- Android - Roboto
- iOS & macOS - SF Pro

**Be sure to use this CSS code in the web front-end**

```css
body {
  font-family: "-apple-system", BlinkMacSystemFont, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
```

## Icons

All icons are optimized using the [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) API. The weight of the icons was reduced by 30-48%. Export settings are specified in [this file](/X/docs/svgo.json).

Icons have been successfully tested on the following platforms: Web, Android, iOS.

**All icons are divided into sections**

### Main

![Icons - Main.img](/01%20-%20design/export/project%20overview/github/icons%20-%20main.png)


In this folder, icons are sorted by type - Outlined, Rounded, Sharp. I always use only one icon type per project. You can download icons separately in the following formats: PDF, SVG. All icon types are also available as fonts in the following formats: EOT, TTF, and WOFF.
