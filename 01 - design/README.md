## Colors

[Here's the SCSS code](/X/System/color%20system.scss) that will create variables for the primary and secondary colors, as well as their shades, and add a palette for grayscale. It is important to use the specified grayscale.

Using this solution, you can easily create a behavior for elements (hover, focus, etc.) and refer to each color and its hue by a variable name.

## Typography

**Be sure to use this CSS code in the web front-end**

```css
