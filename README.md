## Colors

[Here's the SCSS code]() that will create variables for the primary and secondary colors, as well as their shades, and add a palette for grayscale. It is important to use the specified grayscale.

Using this solution, you can easily create a behavior for elements (hover, focus, etc.) and refer to each color and its hue by a variable name.

## Typography

Depending on the platform, you should use the following fonts:

**Be sure to use this CSS code in the web front-end**

```css
body {
    font-family: "-apple-system",BlinkMacSystemFont,Arial,sans-serif;
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
```

## Icons
